    <!-- to add link we will use a Tag or Anchor Tag -->
<!-- In a tag we have a attribute href . If we don't give href we can't add a link so href is important -->
<!-- we will use ==> target="_blank"==> so after cliking on link it will open in new tab -->

   <!-- <a href="thankyou.html"> Thankyou </a> -->
    <br>
<!-- so in line number 13 i have given a folder name bcoz thankyou.html is in same folder and thankyou.html is
      having some contain in it so i created a link so i can revert data written in it.
       We Can USE  ==>  ./thankyou it's meaning is inside the current folder or directory.    -->

    <!-- now i will make one folder its name will pages and inside pages folder there will be thankyou html file
         so line number 14 will not work . so see below-->
    <a href="./pages/thankyou.html"> Thankyou </a>
